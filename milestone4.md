> In our last milestone our webpages were writtin in HTML. Our goal for this milestone was to translate all of our pages into React. Setting up our application in React creates a foundation for us to move forward and start developing responsive map interactions. By making the map responsive, it will enhance the user's ability to visualize the data we pull from our APIs through use of region color shading.

> We improved upon our first UI skeleton by implementing a multi-part form that handles narrowing down location regions to zipcodes. This helps define the area the user is interested in seeing more information about and also identifies zipcodes to retrieve data for through the use of our APIs.

## Addressing User Privacy

> Our web application allows users to vizualize different metrics, including safety, school rating, and walkability, for a specified area of their choosing. In order to do this our application pulls from multiple freely-available open data APIs. Our application does not collect any personal information about the user, thus protecting the privacy of the user.
