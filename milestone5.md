## Explanation of UI Changes

In out last milestone, our Map view and our List view were on separate pages. For this milestone, the biggest change we made is incorporating both the Map and the List in the same page and having them side by side.

Another change we made is previously we were showing the zipcodes for a city and showing the average home values for each zipcode. For this milestone, we instead changed it to show the neighborhoods for the selected city along with average home values for each neighborhood.

We also added the neighborhood boundaries of the selected city to the Map component instead of just the plain Map from our previous milestone.
