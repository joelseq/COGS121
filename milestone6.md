## Explanation of UI Changes and Data Visualizations

In out last milestone, our Map was static only displaying the different neighborhoods outlined along with the listing next to it. For this milestone, we added interactions to the map so that upon hovering on a outlined neighborhood, the area that the user is hovering on will change color. Additionally, we added a new area at the top of the list view where the details for the hovered upon area are presented. These interactions add interactivity to our listings page and the manner in which we visualize our data. 

Another change we made is previously we were showing the different neighborhood names and prices with the ability to sort them in ascending or descening order. For this milestone, we added the walkability api to include the walkability score for each neighborhood. 

We also came up with a brand language and applied it to all screens in our application to make the look and feel of the application more aesthetic and pleasing to our end user.
