## Proposal

One of our project proposals is to create a Facebook data visualization application. Facebook constantly collects data from its users whether it is through their application or through usage of connected applications. We want to make a web application that allows users to view their Facebook data in an organized manner. This would be done by organizing and visualizing data of the userâ€™s choice. It is possible for any user to download their own data through the Facebook website.

Our second project proposal is making an application that helps users make a more informed choice when finding a place to eat. We would be combining the food reviewing capabilities of Yelp with the live traffic capabilities of Google Maps. With this application users can consider their location and travel time to their destination in conjunction with where they want to eat.
